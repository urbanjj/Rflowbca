### *Jongjin Yun (2025-07-24)*

`flowbcaR` is an R implementation of the Stata package `flowbca`, a hierarchical clustering algorithm for flow data. This package is used to identify functional regions by analyzing interactions (e.g., population movement) between spatial units such as administrative districts. Additionally, `flowbcaR` provides various functions to help understand the algorithm's results.

## Background and Methodology

`flowbcaR` is based on the `flowbca` algorithm for Stata developed by Meekes and Hassink (2018). This algorithm is an agglomerative hierarchical clustering method that focuses on the **flow** between units.

The core idea of the algorithm is as follows:

1.  **Initial State**: Starts with all individual units (e.g., regions) as separate clusters.
2.  **Optimization Function**: At each step, it evaluates the bidirectional flow between all pairs of units. The optimization function identifies the two units with the strongest interaction. The flow can be evaluated based on the following criteria:
    - **Directionality**: Sum of directed or undirected flows.
    - **Scale**: Absolute flow volume or relative flow volume compared to total outflow.
3.  **Merging**: Based on the optimization function, the source unit is merged into the destination unit that receives the larger flow. The destination unit is defined as the core.
4.  **Iteration**: Steps 2-3 are repeated until all units form a single cluster or a user-defined stopping condition (e.g., target number of clusters, minimum flow threshold) is met.

This methodology can be useful in various fields such as regional economic analysis, industrial linkage analysis, and social network analysis. After clustering, the self-containment of the formed clusters can be evaluated using indicators like the internal relative flow.

## Analysis Workflow

The functions in `flowbcaR` follow a systematic analysis flow. Each function uses the output of the previous step as input to progressively refine the analysis. A typical workflow is as follows.

1.  **`flowbca()`**: Performs clustering using the original flow data (`OD_SiGun`). The output is a list containing `unit_set`, `cluster_set`, `F_matrix_history`, etc.
2.  **`build_hierarchy()`**: Takes the `unit_set` from `flowbca()` to generate a text-based hierarchy of how each unit is merged. The merge hierarchy can be easily understood as a tree structure in text form using the data.tree package.
3.  **`flowbca_stat()`**: Uses the `F_matrix_history` from `flowbca()` to calculate the statistical properties of each clustering step. It provides the mean, median, maximum, and minimum values for the self-containment of the clusters.
4.  **`flowbca_plot()`**: Visualizes the results of `flowbca_stat()` to show the change in cluster cohesion. It is dynamically implemented to display values when the `upper_bound` is less than 20.
5.  **`flowbca_gis()`**: Combines the `unit_set` from `flowbca()` with the original spatial data (`KR_SiGun`) to create a map layer for each clustering step. It provides a map for visualization by removing holes inside the merged polygons.
6.  **`flowbca_ani()`**: Collects the map layers created by `flowbca_gis()` to create a dynamic GIF animation of the clustering process. It shows the merging process according to the steps.

The diagram below visually represents the relationships between these functions and the data flow. Using the results of the `flowbca()` function, it generates a hierarchical structure, statistics and visualizations for cluster self-containment, and GIS data and animations for visualization.

## Sample Data

This package includes two example datasets based on the Si-Gun units of South Korea. You can load them using the `data()` command.

-   **`OD_SiGun`**: Origin-Destination (OD) data representing the traffic volume between 159 Si-Gun units.
-   **`KR_SiGun`**: `sf` spatial data containing the administrative boundaries of the 159 Si-Gun units.

Before inputting the data into the `flowbca()` function, a preprocessing step is needed to format it correctly. `flowbca()` requires a data.frame in the form of an Origin-Destination matrix. The `OD_SiGun` data includes both the origin code (`SiGun_CD`) and name (`SiGun_NM`), but the function only needs **one column** representing the origin ID.

Also, the origin ID in the first column must exactly match the destination IDs (column names) in the remaining columns. Here, we use `SiGun_NM` as the ID and prepare the data by removing the unnecessary `SiGun_CD` column.

```{r prepare-data, echo=TRUE}
library(flowbcaR)
library(sf)

# Load the sample datasets
data(OD_SiGun)
data(KR_SiGun)

# Prepare the flow data for the algorithm
# The first column must be the source unit ID, and the destination column
# names must match the source unit IDs.
# We remove the first column ("SiGun_CD") to meet this requirement.
flow_input <- OD_SiGun[, -1]
colnames(flow_input) <- c('SiGun_NM',flow_input[,1])

# Check the prepared data
print("Prepared OD Data for flowbca:")
print(flow_input[1:5, 1:6])
print(head(KR_SiGun))
```

## Core Functions


The `flowbcaR` package provides several core functions for data clustering, hierarchy generation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

### `flowbca()`

This is the core function that performs hierarchical clustering based on flow data. It follows the logic of Stata's `flowbca.ado` and allows setting various merging criteria and stopping conditions.

-   **`data`**: A data frame where the first column is the origin ID and the rest are flow volumes by destination.
-   **`q`**: The minimum flow threshold for merging clusters. A relative threshold is specified as a ratio, and an absolute threshold is specified as an integer. If the specified threshold is greater than the maximum value in the entire flow data, the algorithm's stopping condition is met, and the procedure terminates. The default is `q = 0`.
-   **`k`**: The target number of clusters.
-   **`opt_f`**: The optimization function (1-4). Four options are available.
    * `opt_f = 1`: directed relative flows approach (default).
    * `opt_f = 2`: undirected relative flows approach.
    * `opt_f = 3`: directed absolute flows approach.
    * `opt_f = 4`: undirected absolute flows approach.
-   **`la`, `lw`, `lm`**: Additional stopping conditions based on the internal relative flow ratio.
    * la: the minimum average of the internal relative flows.
    * lw: the minimum weighted average of the internal relative flows.
    * lm: the minimum internal relative flow.
- **`save_k`**: Whether to return the F_matrix for all rounds. The default is FALSE.

```{r example}
# The 'flow_input' data was prepared in the chunk above.
# We will run the clustering until the minimum internal relative flow ratio exceeds 10%.
# By setting lm to 0.1, we ensure that all objects include more than one Si and Gun.
bca_result <- flowbca(flow_input, lm=0.1, save_k = TRUE)

# The result is a list containing:
# 1. unit_set: Details of cluster assignment for each unit
# 2. cluster_set: Statistics for the final clusters
# 3. F_matrix: The final aggregated flow matrix
# 4. F_matrix_history: A list of matrices from each clustering round
str(bca_result$unit_set, 3)
str(bca_result$cluster_set, 3)
```

### `build_hierarchy()`

Uses the `unit_set` from the `flowbca` result to generate a hierarchical path showing how each unit is merged into a higher-level cluster.

-   **`data`**: The `unit_set` data frame from the `flowbca` result.
-   **`child_col`**: The column name for the child unit (default: "sourceunit").
-   **`parent_col`**: The column name for the parent unit (default: "destinationunit").

```{r hierarchy}
# Build the hierarchy path from the result
hierarchy_data <- build_hierarchy(bca_result$unit_set)

# View the hierarchy for a few units
# 'hierarchy' column shows the full merge path
# 'h_level' shows the depth in the hierarchy
head(hierarchy_data[, c("sourceunit", "clusterid", "hierarchy", "h_level")])
```

You can visualize the cluster hierarchy as text using the data.tree package.

```{r data.tree}
library(data.tree)
# data.tree package
node <- paste0('nation/', hierarchy_data$hierarchy)
tree <- data.tree::as.Node(data.frame(pathString=node))

## Tree structure of the cluster hierarchy
print(tree, 'level', limit=10)

## Explore the sub-tree structure for Busan
print(tree$Busan)

```

### `flowbca_stat()` & `flowbca_plot()`

Calculates and visualizes statistics of the internal flow ratio for each step (round) of the clustering process. This helps to understand how the cohesion of the clusters changes.

-   **`flowbca_stat(matrix_list)`**: Takes the `F_matrix_history` from the `flowbca` result as input and calculates the mean, minimum, median, and maximum internal flow ratios for each round.
-   **`flowbca_plot(stat_data)`**: Uses the data generated by `flowbca_stat` to plot the statistics.

```{r stat_plot, fig.show='hold', out.width="100%", fig.width=10,fig.height=5}
# Calculate internal flow statistics from the matrix history
stat_data <- flowbca_stat(bca_result$F_matrix_history)
head(stat_data)

# Plot the statistics
# The x-axis represents the number of clusters + 1
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
flowbca_plot(stat_data, upper_bound = 50)
flowbca_plot(stat_data, upper_bound = 20)
```

### `flowbca_gis()`

Combines the clustering results from `flowbca` with spatial data (`sf` object) to create merged polygon layers for each merging step.

-   **`unit_set`**: The `unit_set` from the `flowbca` result.
-   **`unit_gis`**: The `sf` spatial data of the original units.
-   **`join_col`**: The column name to use when joining the two datasets. (e.g., `join_col = c('sourceunit' = 'SiGun_NM')`)

```{r gis, out.width="100%", fig.width=10,fig.height=10}
# Generate merged spatial layers for each round
# This can take a moment
gis_layers <- flowbca_gis(bca_result$unit_set, KR_SiGun, join_col=c('sourceunit'='SiGun_NM'))

# The result is a named list of sf objects
# The names correspond to the round number (number of clusters + 1)
print(paste("Number of spatial layers created:", length(gis_layers)))

# Plot the final clustered boundaries
# The colors for each round are assigned arbitrarily
par(mfrow = c(2, 2),       
    mar = c(0.1, 0.1, 1, 0.1),
    oma = c(0, 0, 0, 0),
    xpd = NA)
plot(gis_layers$`160`["sourceunit"],key.pos = NULL,reset = FALSE,main = "160",asp=NA)
plot(gis_layers$`100`["sourceunit"],key.pos = NULL,reset = FALSE,main = "100",asp=NA)
plot(gis_layers$`50`["sourceunit"],key.pos = NULL,reset = FALSE,main = "50",asp=NA)
plot(gis_layers$`14`["sourceunit"],key.pos = NULL,reset = FALSE,main = "14",asp=NA)
```

### `flowbca_ani()`

Uses the list of spatial layers generated by `flowbca_gis` to create a GIF animation showing the clustering process.

-   **`flowbca_gis`**: The result from the `flowbca_gis` function.
-   **`unit_set`**: The `unit_set` from the `flowbca` result.
-   **`filenm`**: The file name for the saved GIF.
-   **`width`**: The width of the saved GIF in pixels. The default is 1000px.
-   **`keep_frames`**: Creates a folder in the current path and saves all frames for the PNG. The default is FALSE.

```{r animation, eval=FALSE}
# This code is not evaluated in the README build to save time,
# but you can run it locally.
# It will create a file named "flowbca_clustering.gif" in your working directory.

flowbca_ani(
  flowbca_gis = gis_layers,
  unit_set = bca_result$unit_set,
  filenm = "flowbca_clustering.gif",
  width = 800
)
```

```{r gif_plot, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./man/figures/flowbca_clustering.gif")
```
