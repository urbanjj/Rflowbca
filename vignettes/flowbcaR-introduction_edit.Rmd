## Introduction

The `flowbcaR` package provides a robust implementation of a flow-based clustering algorithm, originally developed by Jordy Meekes (2018) as a Stata package. It is specifically designed to delineate functional regions (e.g., labor market areas, travel-to-work areas) by analyzing origin-destination (OD) flow data. The core function, `flowbca`, iteratively aggregates spatial units based on the strength of the flows between them, using a hierarchical clustering approach with detailed tie-breaking rules to ensure deterministic and logical outcomes.

This vignette provides an overview of the package's main functions, which are categorized into three groups: **Diagnosis**, **Hierarchy**, and **Visualization**. These tools allow users not only to perform the core clustering but also to evaluate the results, analyze the cluster hierarchy, and visualize the outcomes geographically.

## Core Function: `flowbca`

The `flowbca()` function is the engine of the package. It takes an origin-destination matrix as input and produces a set of clusters. You can control its behavior through various parameters, such as the optimization function (`opt_f`) to use relative or absolute flows, and stopping conditions (`k`, `q`, etc.) to terminate the algorithm at a desired state.

## Diagnosis Functions

These functions are used to assess the quality of the clustering results and to help determine the most appropriate number of clusters. A proper diagnosis is crucial for interpreting the output of `flowbca`.

### `flowbca_stat`

*   **Purpose**: This function calculates summary statistics for each step of the clustering process. For each round (i.e., for each number of clusters), it computes the mean, minimum, median, and maximum of the internal relative flows within clusters. It also calculates the overall ratio of intra-cluster flow (flow within clusters) to inter-cluster flow (flow between clusters).
*   **Advantages**: Provides key quantitative metrics to objectively evaluate how cluster cohesion evolves as units are merged. The output is a tidy data frame, making it easy to use for further analysis or plotting.
*   **Disadvantages**: The raw statistics can be hard to interpret without visualization. It requires the history of flow matrices from `flowbca`, which can consume memory if the number of units is large.
*   **Use Cases**: Essential for post-clustering analysis. The statistics can be plotted to find an "elbow" or a point where the rate of change in cluster cohesion slows down, suggesting an optimal number of clusters.
*   **Considerations**: To use this function, you must run `flowbca` with the `save_k = TRUE` argument to store the necessary historical data.

### `flowbca_plot`

*   **Purpose**: Visualizes the statistics generated by `flowbca_stat`. It produces a two-panel plot: the left panel shows the distribution of internal relative flows (mean, median, min, max), and the right panel shows the trend of intra-cluster vs. inter-cluster flow ratios.
*   **Advantages**: Offers an intuitive visual guide to the diagnostic statistics. It automatically highlights the intersection point of the intra- and inter-cluster flow lines, a common heuristic for identifying the optimal clustering level where internal cohesion is balanced with external separation.
*   **Disadvantages**: The plots can become cluttered if the number of clustering rounds is very large.
*   **Use Cases**: The primary method for visually identifying the optimal number of clusters. It's excellent for including in reports to justify the choice of a particular cluster solution.
*   **Considerations**: The x-axis represents the number of clusters and is typically plotted in reverse order (from many clusters to few).

### `flowbca_modularity`

*   **Purpose**: Calculates the modularity score for each step of the clustering process. Modularity is a standard metric in network science that measures the density of links inside communities compared to links between communities.
*   **Advantages**: Provides a single, well-established score for evaluating the quality of a network partition. A higher modularity score generally indicates a better-defined community structure.
*   **Disadvantages**: Modularity calculation can be computationally intensive. It is also known to have a "resolution limit," where it may fail to detect smaller, well-defined clusters.
*   **Use Cases**: To identify the level of clustering that yields the highest modularity. This is often considered the most statistically significant or "natural" grouping of the units.
*   **Considerations**: Like `flowbca_stat`, this function requires the `save_k = TRUE` argument in the `flowbca` call. Modularity values between 0.3 and 0.7 are often cited as indicating significant community structure, but this is a general guideline.

### `flowbca_diagnosis`

*   **Purpose**: This is a high-level wrapper function that automates the entire diagnostic workflow. It runs `flowbca` under different settings (relative and absolute flows), computes all the diagnostic statistics using `flowbca_stat` and `flowbca_modularity`, and generates a comprehensive set of plots for comparison.
*   **Advantages**: Extremely convenient, providing a full diagnostic report with a single function call. It simplifies the process of comparing different clustering criteria.
*   **Disadvantages**: Offers less granular control than running the functions individually. The resulting multi-panel plot can be dense and may require careful examination.
*   **Use Cases**: This should be the first step after an initial `flowbca` run. It is the recommended tool for deciding on the final parameters for `flowbca` and for selecting the optimal number of clusters.
*   **Considerations**: Since it runs `flowbca` multiple times, it can be time-consuming for large datasets.

## Hierarchy Functions

Once a final clustering is performed, these functions help analyze and organize the resulting hierarchical structure.

### `build_hierarchy`

*   **Purpose**: Enriches the `unit_set` output from `flowbca` by adding explicit hierarchical information. It traces the parent-child relationships from the merge history to create a full path string for each unit (e.g., `World/Europe/Germany`), determines each unit's level in the hierarchy, and flags which units act as parents.
*   **Advantages**: Creates a human-readable and intuitive representation of the cluster hierarchy. It is implemented in base R for maximum portability.
*   **Disadvantages**: The hierarchy path is stored as a single string, which may require additional parsing for complex programmatic queries.
*   **Use Cases**: For understanding the nested relationships between clusters. As a preparatory step for creating hierarchical labels in plots or maps.
*   **Considerations**: The function operates on the `unit_set` data frame returned by `flowbca`.

### `build_cluster_tree`

*   **Purpose**: Converts the flat merge history from `unit_set` into a formal nested-list structure, which is the standard way to represent trees in R.
*   **Advantages**: The nested-list format is a powerful and flexible data structure that is directly compatible with many other R packages for tree analysis and visualization (e.g., converting to a `dendrogram`).
*   **Disadvantages**: The resulting object can be complex to inspect manually if the hierarchy is deep or has many nodes.
*   **Use Cases**: A crucial intermediate step for any advanced hierarchical analysis. It is used as input for `hierarchy_cluster` and for creating dendrograms with `list_to_dendrogram`.
*   **Considerations**: The output is a list where each element is a root of a tree, containing its children as a nested list.

### `hierarchy_cluster`

*   **Purpose**: This powerful function analyzes the hierarchy tree at every possible level. It effectively "cuts" the tree at each height to extract the set of clusters that exist at that level of aggregation.
*   **Advantages**: Enables a multi-resolution analysis of the regional structure. It systematically extracts cluster definitions at different spatial scales (e.g., from local neighborhoods to broad regions).
*   **Disadvantages**: The concept and the output format are complex. The function returns a list containing lists of data frames, which requires careful handling.
*   **Use Cases**: To extract and map functional regions at different levels of the hierarchy. For comparative analysis of how regions merge and grow.
*   **Considerations**: This function takes the output of `build_cluster_tree` as its input.

## Visualization Functions

These functions are dedicated to creating geographical and graphical representations of the clustering results.

### `flowbca_map`

*   **Purpose**: Generates a static map of a chosen set of clusters. It displays the cluster boundaries as colored polygons and can also highlight the "core" units within each cluster.
*   **Advantages**: Provides a straightforward and publication-ready visualization of the final spatial regions.
*   **Disadvantages**: The map is static and offers limited customization. For interactive maps, the output `sf` objects would need to be exported to a different tool (like `leaflet` or `mapview`).
*   **Use Cases**: Creating the definitive map of the final delineated regions for a report or presentation. Visually assessing the geographic coherence and contiguity of the clusters.
*   **Considerations**: Requires an `sf` object containing the geometries of the base spatial units. The `unit_set` input should contain the cluster definitions, typically from `flowbca` or `hierarchy_cluster`.

### `flowbca_gis_layer`

*   **Purpose**: This function is a geometric workhorse. It takes the merge history from `flowbca` and an `sf` object of the base units, and it generates a sequence of `sf` objects, one for each round of the clustering. Each `sf` object represents the spatially dissolved clusters at that step.
*   **Advantages**: Creates the necessary spatial data for animating the clustering process or for conducting spatial analysis at any intermediate step of the hierarchy.
*   **Disadvantages**: Can be very computationally intensive and slow, especially with a large number of units or high-resolution geometries, as it involves repeated geometric union operations.
*   **Use Cases**: Primarily used as a data preparation step for the `flowbca_ani` function. It can also be used to extract the map of clusters at any specific round.
*   **Considerations**: The output is a large, named list of `sf` objects, which can consume significant memory.

### `flowbca_ani`

*   **Purpose**: Creates a GIF animation that visualizes the entire hierarchical clustering process from start to finish. Each frame shows one merge event, with the absorbing cluster highlighted.
*   **Advantages**: Offers a highly intuitive and dynamic way to understand how the algorithm constructs the regions. It is an excellent tool for communication and teaching.
*   **Disadvantages**: This is the most computationally expensive function in the package. It can take a very long time and a lot of memory to render the animation, as it must generate a separate plot for each of the hundreds or thousands of merge steps.
*   **Use Cases**: For presentations or web content to demonstrate the dynamic nature of the regionalization process. For diagnosing the clustering process by watching the sequence of merges.
*   **Considerations**: It requires the `magick` package. Performance is greatly improved if the `ragg` package is also installed. The input must be the list of `sf` objects created by `flowbca_gis_layer`.
