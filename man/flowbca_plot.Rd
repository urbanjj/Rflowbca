\title{Plot Flow Statistics}
\usage{
flowbca_plot(stat_data, upper_bound = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{stat_data}{A data frame with flow statistics, typically the output of \code{flowbca_stat}.}

\item{upper_bound}{An optional integer. If provided, only data points with a 'round'
value less than or equal to this upper bound will be plotted.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. This function is called for its side effect of
creating a plot.
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame of flow statistics and creates a side-by-side plot
to visualize the results. The first plot shows the mean, min, median, and max
internal flow ratios. The second plot shows the intra- and inter-cluster flow ratios.
}
\details{
Plot Flow Statistics Over Clustering Rounds (Optimized)

Visualizes flow statistics with a fixed y-axis (0-1) and dynamic plot styles.
This optimized version is more robust, readable, and handles edge cases.
}
\examples{
# The function is designed to be used with `flowbca_run()`,
# which returns a list containing the `stats` data frame.
# For a standalone example, we first need to generate some data.

# Create a list of matrices for demonstration
matrix_list <- list(
  `10` = matrix(runif(100), 10, 10),
  `9` = matrix(runif(81), 9, 9),
  `8` = matrix(runif(64), 8, 8),
  `7` = matrix(runif(49), 7, 7),
  `6` = matrix(runif(36), 6, 6),
  `5` = matrix(runif(25), 5, 5),
  `4` = matrix(runif(16), 4, 4),
  `3` = matrix(runif(9), 3, 3)
)

# Generate statistics
stats <- flowbca_stat(matrix_list)

# Plot the statistics
flowbca_plot(stats)

# Plot with an upper bound
flowbca_plot(stats, upper_bound = 7)
}
