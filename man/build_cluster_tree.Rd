\title{Build a Nested List Representing the Cluster Hierarchy}
\usage{
build_cluster_tree(unit_set)
}
\arguments{
\item{unit_set}{A data frame from a \code{flowbca} result, containing at least
\code{sourceunit} and \code{destinationunit} columns defining the parent-child links.}
}
\value{
A named, nested list representing the cluster hierarchy. Each name is a
node, and its value is a list of its children. Leaf nodes are empty lists.
}
\description{
This function converts the flat parent-child relationship in \code{unit_set} into a
nested list (tree) structure. This is useful for hierarchical analysis or
visualization with tree-based packages.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Assuming 'bca_result' is the output from flowbca()
  tree <- build_cluster_tree(bca_result$unit_set)
  # You can inspect the tree structure
  str(tree)
  # Access a specific sub-tree
  seoul_cluster <- tree$Seoul
}
}
